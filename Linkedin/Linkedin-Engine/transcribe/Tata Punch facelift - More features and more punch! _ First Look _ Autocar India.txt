 if ever there was a car named ironically it was Tata's smallest SUV because for something called the punch it really didn't have any until now because this is the facelifted Tata punch and finally they've given into demand and launched it with a turbo petrol engine I'm Gavin this is Autocar India this is the new punch tell me what you think about it down in the comments and I hope you're subscribed to the channel first things first right up front that's where most of the changes are it's a little bit nexon it's a little bit punch evie and all together i think it now folds in with the new tata motors family face the grill up here is a lot smaller a lot slimmer and these led elements are very very distinct there isn't much of an opening here all the openings are down there and this area is a whole lot bigger than before the headlamp cluster is it's all led this time and it's more of a vertical arrangement and very very angular what you'll also notice is that the bumper is a little bit chunkier in fact overall the car's length has increased by about 49 millimeters that's almost two inches but that's all down to the bumpers mechanically it's pretty much the same around the side it's familiar stuff the overall profile hasn't changed too much the wheels are still 16 inches but the design has changed you still get black cladding and very squared off wheel arches and this huge black cladding over here down the side instantly ground clearance seems to have gone up from 187 to 193 mm and tata is really reinforcing the fact that this is a proper suv not just a hatchback in disguise in fact they've reiterated this by showing us a bunch of statistics including its 400 millimeters of water weighting capability and class leading approach and departure angles now that's not something you generally hear about when it comes to a compact car like this around the back some more prominent changes a connected led bar over here and led tail lamps out on the corner now here it's a lot of black uh treatment around the leds and i think that takes away some of the car's character those tri-arrow patterns that you used to get in the old led tail lamps those were very distinctive this i think looks a little bit generic overall i think the design is a bit homogeneous with the rest of tata motors uh family language and i don't think it's quite as distinct as the original punch but you tell me what you think down in the comments lift up the tailgate and you'll find a 366 liter boot which tata motors says is class leading and yes it goes down quite deep over here Of course, if you opt for the iCNG version, that reduces to 210 liters, I believe. But that's also better than most CNG cars because you have dual cylinder technology and the CNG tanks are under the floor, giving some more space for your boot and luggage. Inside here, surprisingly, little has changed. But then again, that's because Tata Motors has always updated its cars throughout their life cycle. So with the facelift, this time it doesn't feel quite as new. but sure it's still very very good you get 10.25 inch touchscreen up here with the latest Tata Motors infotainment software and a 7 inch digital screen over there part digital cluster all around the tachometer is still analog but it's very informative and it's got loads and loads of information if a bit small on the font size the steering wheel is Tata's newer design and that we've already seen on the Punch EV and unfortunately they've replaced the nice rotary knob for the AC controls with these toggle switches and touch controls. I find the old knob system a whole lot better than this but hey that's in keeping with Tata Motors latest design. The dashboard as before is this dual tone layered thing and that in itself is quite a nice effect. The AC vents are surrounded by this gloss black plastic but the dashboard materials do feel a little bit hard and scratchy. I wish there was a way for them to disguise this a little bit better. it does pretty well i suppose for the segment it's not too bad but yeah there's no escaping the fact that this is very hard scratchy plastic right in front of you there what i do like is what they've done with the seats which are fabric upholstered of course that's not an issue they've even added this nice uh under thigh support extender here which actually does the job really well and overall very supportive seats and this fabric seems very very high quality now of course the punch gets a sunroof a wireless charger and as i mentioned these digital screens over here and the tata punch has been slowly growing its features list over the years like with the design of the cabin some of the updates have been introduced earlier so the drones feel brand new right now but yes this car is seriously loaded with this facelift in top spec guys let's take a look at some of those features now the rear seat of the punch as before isn't the most spacious to be in but then this is a very compact car a sub compact suv so i think it's about par for the course they have scooped out some headroom here but it is pretty tight i'm just under five foot eight and yeah i've just got a little bit of space above my head so taller passengers beware what they have done is a great job on the seat because like the front there's a little bit of thigh support extension over here and you do sit a bit upright but the seat itself is nice and comfy there's a nice soft armrest no cup holders here though but three point seat belts all around and adjustable headrest at least on the two outside the thing about the punch is that it uses its verticality really well both at the front and at the back giving you a great view forward and a great view out so even though it's quite compact back here you don't feel too hemmed in because again the upper upholstery is all very light colored and you're sat at a height that gives you a great view out of these pretty big windows so all things considered a pretty comfortable back seat there's a 15 watt usb c charger and there are ac vents which they added like a lot of things in this car a little bit earlier but yeah that now completes the rear seat package of the tata punch tata motors has always been big on safety and it's no different with the updated punch the car has already scored a five-star bharat and cat crash test rating for both adult and child safety and in one of its own independent test tata motors even crashed it against a stationary truck at 50 kph and came up with a pretty good result as for the biggest change it's under the hood it's data motors 1.2 liter turbocharged petrol engine from the nexon and the altros and it makes the full 120 horsepower and 170 newton meters of torque now over here it's only made it to a six-speed manual there's no dca or automatic with that but the old engine continues the 1.2 naturally aspirated petrol with a five-speed manual on the 5-speed AMT as well as the 1.2 CNG with a 5-speed manual and yes a 5-speed AMT for the CNG as well. Well the Tata Punch facelift price starts at 5.59 lakh rupees for the entry-level model and it goes up to about 8.99 lakh rupees for the 1.2 petrol fully loaded manual so what do you think of the prices of the facelifted Tata punch tell us down in the comments it's been improved in many crucial ways and it was the best-selling car of 2024 in India do you think it has what it takes to come up to that position once again let us know and we'll be driving it very very soon so stay subscribed
