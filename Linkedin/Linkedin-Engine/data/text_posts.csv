In 2024,Tata Motorstook the crown, selling over 2.02 lakh units of the Tata Punch, surpassing the Wagon R’s 1.91 lakh units.

This marks a significant shift in India’s car market, where compact SUVs and premium cars are gaining popularity, breaking the decades-long dominance of affordable hatchbacks.

What’s happening Indian automakers like Tata Motors, Bajaj, Maruti Suzuki, TVS, and Hero want to enter the European EV market. They are doing this in two ways: Buying European companies to get access to advanced design, tech, and branding. Exporting their own EVs (cars, bikes, scooters) directly to Europe. Examples Tata Motors bought Iveco’s commercial vehicle business in Italy. Bajaj Auto took full control of KTM. TVS bought an Italian design company, Engines Engineering, to make premium vehicles. Hero MotoCorp and Ultraviolette plan to sell their electric two-wheelers in Europe. Challenges Europe’s car market is sluggish right now (people are buying fewer cars). Chinese EV companies (like BYD) are very aggressive in Europe, making competition tough. Some past attempts by Indian firms in Europe (like TVS–Norton, Ashok Leyland in UK) didn’t succeed. Why it matters Indian companies get access to advanced European tech and design skills. It helps build a premium global brand image. It diversifies revenue — not only from India but also from global markets. #EQUITY #AUTOSECTOR #FINANCE || Day 4 of My 100-Day Automobile Journey Maruti Suzuki & the EV Dilemma When I first thought of cars, the first name that came to mind was Maruti Suzuki. In my village, the Maruti 800 was a dream car. Even today, families proudly talk about buying a Swift, Dzire, or WagonR. But here’s the twist — as I’m researching the automobile sector for my 100-day challenge, I realized: 👉 In the EV race, Maruti is not the leader. It’s the laggard. 🔍 What I Found Out Suzuki Motor (parent) has promised a $8 billion EV investment in India. The first EV, eVITARA, has just been shipped — 2,900 units exported to 12 European nations. Meanwhile, Tata Motors sold 8,540 EVs in August 2025 alone — almost 3x Maruti’s entire first export batch. Maruti is still relying on hybrids, CNG & petrol dominance — which gave them ₹1,45,115 crore net sales in FY25. Only now, in 2025, they’re talking about gigafactories & large-scale EV production. ⚡ Why They Fell Behind (My Reflection) Reading all this, I asked myself: Why did the king of Indian roads fall behind in EVs? And the answers were eye-opening 👇 They played safe: focused on ICE cars, afraid EVs wouldn’t be affordable for the masses. They started late: Tata took the first-mover advantage back in 2020. They had no early battery strategy: no gigafactories, no raw material tie-ups. Their parent company, Suzuki, was itself late to the global EV game. Basically, while Maruti was defending the present, Tata was building the future. 🧠 My Takeaway This hit me personally because I see how companies (and people like us) sometimes play it “safe” — and by the time we act, someone else has already taken the lead. Maruti still has trust, reach, and scale. But trust alone won’t win the EV race. The next 2 years will decide if their $8B bet can close the gap, or if Tata has already locked in the crown. 👉 Now I want to hear from you: If you had to place your bet on the future of EVs in India — would you back Maruti’s scale or Tata’s head-start? Parth Verma The Valuation School #MarutiSuzuki #EVIndia #AutomobileSector #Day4Challenge #LinkedInGrowth || Maruti's Bold Move in SUV Market. Maruti is targeting younger buyers with its new SUV, the Fronx (Victoris), and has different sales channels to avoid competition between its own models. Hyundai’s Creta Electric sales have dropped this year, but Creta is still very popular, with many loyal customers buying it again or upgrading from smaller Hyundai cars. Maruti offers CNG options in both its new Victoris and Grand Vitara SUVs, providing more choices as demand for CNG vehicles grows. Hyundai still leads in engine power with its turbo motors, a feature that Maruti lacks. While Maruti is making bold moves with more options and a strong sales network, it will be challenging to overtake Hyundai Creta’s top position in the market. #SUVMarket #AutomotiveIndustry #MarutiSuzuki #Hyundai #IndiaAutomobile S&J Advisory"

I usually don’t write such posts, but after my experience with Tata Punch and the after-sales service, I feel it’s important to share.
Right after purchasing, the AC compressor failed and had to be replaced.

A few months later, after an accident repair at Tata Sagar Motors, Sec-62, Noida the issues only multiplied – improper windshield fitting, mismatched paintwork, and even water leakage into the cabin and cabin light.

It’s been 8 months since, and I’m still struggling with these flaws. 

Whether it’s poor service quality or possible manufacturing defects, the experience has been disappointing to say the least.

As a customer, I trustedTata Motorsfor reliability and safety, but continuous issues like these really question that trust.

I hope Tata Motors takes note of such cases seriously and ensures better quality checks and customer support.

What’s your take on this,Tata Motors? Tata MotorsThis is one of the problems. 
There are more like every IGL Pump denies to fill CNG in Tata Car because of different Nozzle. We have to wait in the lines to fill cng and what we got in return that we can’t fill cng in tata cars. Dear Mr. Bhardwaj, we’re sorry to hear about the problems you’ve faced. We’d like to help you with this. Please share contact number via DM, and we’ll have our team assist you as soon as possible. Haa haa always keep a bucket with you. Tata Motors its very common issues customer care people will send a general message we are sorry to hear and will try to solve the problem ASAP but later Tata they will put some M Seal and return you the same vehicle and they will give one PKT M Seal also and for next time they will show you how apply. For me for 35 lakhs I got defective Tata safari day 1 within 100 kms while coming out of the showroom engine burnt out timing chain broke while driving and came out. Initially they don't worry we will try for replacement later they told they replaced all parts with atmost care so I have to take the same defective car. When I asked for replacement they told me to proceed legally now fighting legally for replacement. Now without car Iam paying my EMI this is present Tata after the Demise of our great late RATAN Tata.  If you need any help call me 7736733440. Tata Motors, you are requested to look into this matter and provide an appropriate resolution at the earliest.

Around 29,000 people lost their lives in road accidents on national highways in just the first six months of 2025.

That’s already more than 50% of last year’s total.
And this is data for only half the year.

It’s a reminder that most accidents don’t happen at extreme speeds or in rare situations. They happen during everyday drives - on familiar roads.

This Tata Punch crash video with a truck made me slow down and watch it till the end.

It felt like something that could happen on any Indian road, any day.

A truck impact at regular driving speed.
The kind of situation you never plan for.
Yet the car holds its shape far better than you’d expect.

If you drive in India, you already know how unpredictable it can be:

* sudden lane changes
* heavy vehicles appearing out of nowhere
* potholes you spot a second too late

That’s where safety stops being a line on a brochure and starts becoming a real decision - especially when you’re choosing a car for your family.

Seeing how the Punch holds up reinforces whyTata Motorshas been pushing safety as a default, not a premium.

The Punch feels confident on the road, and more importantly, reassuring when things don’t go as planned.

Safety first. Meanwhile wagonr testing with bajaj platina 😝 That’s why I just loveTata Motorsmore than any other cars in India. Must watch video! Tata is best when it comes to safety ! Everyday drives carry hidden risks.

Moments like this underline why safety decisions should be boring, practical, and made long before accidents happen. Safety is a responsibility.
Eye opener This really highlights how crucial real-world safety features are. It’s reassuring to see Tata Punch performing well in situations many drivers face daily. The truck impact looked like something that could happen any day. It’s a reminder that real-world safety is the kind you feel, not just read about. Seeing the Punch take that impact really puts safety into perspective.
It’s one thing to read about ratings, and another to see how a car actually holds up. To view or add a comment,sign in Create your free account or sign in to continue your search Don’t have the app?
